Learning go.

+ get all aws ec2 instance types in all regions
+ practice using coroutines and semaphores to cap concurrency
+ explore golang gob for caching expensive aws requests
+ todo: consider how to add check to see if instance type is availabe
  right now. Instance can be offered in a region but all instances
  could be consumed atm. How can we check this efficiently?
